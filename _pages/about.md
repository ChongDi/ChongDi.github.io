About me
======
I received the B.S. degree from Xidian University, in 2016. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests include machine learning, reinforcement learning, and learning automata and their applications.

Research
======

NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA

**Research on Learning Automata for Influence Maximization in Large-scale Dynamic Networks**
1. Improve the existing parameter-free learning automata algorithm, based on the Bayesian statistical learning theory, propose an efficient parameter-free learning automata scheme；
2. Aiming at the large-scale action-set environment, based on hypothesis testing, design a novel learning automata learning framework to improve the learning efficiency of the learning automata algorithm；
3. Aiming at the characteristics of fuzzy feedback from environment, a parameter-free learning automata algorithm suitable for Q-model environments is proposed；
4. In the problem of influence maximization, a solution based on conjugate learning automata is proposed, which breaks the theoretical upper bound of the traditional Greedy-based algorithms；
5. Aiming at the characteristics of dynamic changes in networks, a conjugate learning automaton is designed to adaptively forget and retain historical information, and a method for maximizing information dissemination suitable for dynamic networks is proposed；

Jobs
======
Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. ｜ INTERN（2020.5-2020.8）

------
During the internship, I investigated, implemented and optimized the audio and video digital watermarking technologies, and combined them with departmental business and products. As of the end of the internship, the technologies are in the business effect evaluation stage. Many departments inside and outside the company are interested in the function. Related work has been publicized in the form of technical decoding on the Tencent Cloud Video Cloud official account and video account.
